# Professional README Generator

## Description

The Professional README Generator is a command-line application built with Node.js that dynamically generates a
professional README.md file based on user input. This application aims to streamline the process of creating
high-quality README files for GitHub repositories. It prompts the user to input information about their project, such as
title, description, installation instructions, usage information, chosen license, GitHub username, and email address.
Additionally, the user can choose to include sections for contributing guidelines and test instructions.
